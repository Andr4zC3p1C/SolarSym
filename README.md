A program for computing the best possible initial time, place and velocity for a launch of an object from one stellar object to the other in a solar system. The program works using Newton's mechanics.

Features:
  - computing the launch time, place and velocity due to the data given(start and end object, time interval of the search and if the object is a rocket or not, if is a rocket then mass of the rocket with and without fuel)
  - can also output a 3D plot of the trajectory
  - can also output a fitted function for the trajectory
  - can also output a simple animation of the object flying
